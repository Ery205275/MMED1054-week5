		 <p>She is an 8 years old Calico cat. I adopted her in February 2020 when i saw an ad on Kijiji said that she would be abandoned. She was quite skinny but she had a really big belly at that time so I thought she was pregnant but turned out her previous owner let she eat too much and she got cubbier real quick that her stomach got big first. Now I can proudly said that her whole body is chubby not just her stomach anymore. I am trying to feed her less and get her to do more excercises but she hates it. She love attention but hate being petted because she is a clean freak. If she did not lick your hand clean before you touch her, she would chase you down and lick your hand violently. She hate Ginger just because he always steal all the attention to himself. </p>

		 <p>He is a Siamese mix and according to what his old onwer told me I think he is around one and a half years old. I would say Ginger is a very shy boy. Because I was the first person that he see when he came to our house so he was always hiding around me when there is another person in the house He is super needy and very vocal. He would cry all night until I get up and pet him for like 3 hours until he is satisfied. During daytime, all he do it's sleeping in many weird position. He is so naive that he was bullied by Fish-sauce all the time but sometimes she let him go away.</p>

		  <p>They are my first pet right after I moved away from my family's city. They are super shy even now after I have them for 2 years. They got fat really quick so I always have to control their meals. Kar is the one with yellow fur and Ma is the one with brown fur. Kar is the noisy one and really brave when she interact with people. She always freaks out when I tried to pick her up after she realize she is safe, she immediately ask for food. Ma is more timid and she loves bath time. Ma's fur is thicker than Kar's fur so when I bathe them Ma's fur is everywhere.</p>
